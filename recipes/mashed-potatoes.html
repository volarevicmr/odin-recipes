    <h3>Description</h3>
    <div class="description">
        <p>During Thanksgiving, that most divisive of holidays, mashed potatoes are perhaps the most divisive side dish of the lot. </p>
        <p>I like mine to be rich, perfectly smooth, and creamy with plenty of butter and heavy cream, loaded with black pepper, maybe some chives if I want to feel extra fancy. Somewhere between a dish on its own and a sauce, it should have the consistency of a pudding, slowly working it's way across a tilted plate. I like to pick up a piece of turkey and swirl it in my gravy-covered potatoes so that they coat it, their buttery richness working into the cracks in the meat. Sounds good, right? Who could possibly want it any other way? </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>4 pounds (1.8kg) russet potatoes </li>
        <li>2 cups (475ml) whole milk </li>
        <li>12 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 1/2 sticks; 6 ounces; 170g), room temperature, cut into 1/2-inch pats</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Peel potatoes and cut into rough chunks, about 1 to 2 inches cubed. Transfer to a bowl of cold water to rinse. Change water 2 or 3 times until it runs clear. </li>
        <li>In a Dutch oven or large stockpot, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil over high heat. Add potatoes and cook until completely tender, about 15 minutes. Drain potatoes in a colander and rinse under hot running water for 30 seconds to wash away excess starch. Set a ricer or food mill over now-empty pot and pass potatoes through. Add milk and butter and fold gently with a rubber spatula to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Keep warm until ready to serve. </li>
    </ol>
